### Colour Scheme
The colours found throughout the website have been taken from the company logo. The main body of the website is a lighter shade of the blue found in the logo and navigation bar. The outcomes of using the lighter shade chosen are:
* Clearer contrast between the background colour and font colour.
* More contrast between the images and background colour.
* A light and non oppressive user experience when compared to a heavy, darker colour.

An even lighter shade of the logo blue can be found in the 'Services' area of the home page, as well as in the Gallery page and the Contact page. This was used in the Gallery page to further accentuate the contrast between images and the background colour. The lighter shade was used in the 'Services' section and on the Contact page to break up the content and to draw the eye of the user to the key information on the page. 

The 'Send' button at the bottom of the contact form is the same blue from the logo, ensuring the element is consistent with the rest of the website.

### Fonts
The font used for all of the headings throughout the website is 'Londrina Solid' from Google Fonts. This font was used in part as it is similar in style to the font found on the company logo. It works well for the website and therefore the business, as it connotes feelings of fun and of being hand made. As a back-up font, 'Impact' has been chosen as it is a very 'web-safe' font, as well as being striking and stencil like, which is appropriate for a website pertaining to art. The company logo font was not chosen for headings as the shadow effect detracted from the clarity of the headers.

The font used for all other text on the website is 'Raleway' from Google Fonts. This font was chosen as it is very legible, even at small font sizes as well as being generally pleasing to the eye. As a back up font, 'Arial' has been selected as it is very 'web-safe' and is also very clear and easily legible.

### Features
#### Implemented Features
Each page features a responsive navigation bar with the navigational links clearly listed to the right of the page, or being found in a dropdown list by clicking a 'hamburger' button which appears on screens 575 pixels wide or less. The logo on the left of the navigation bar also serves as a link to the home page - a feature which is widely used in web design and therefore expected by the user. Each page also features the same footer which contains a link to the business' email address, links to the business' social network pages and the copyright infomation for the website. All clickable links are clearly indicated with a subtle change in colour when the curser is hovered over them. The footer also implements responsive design by reordering the footer content to push the copyright information to the bottom of the screen and the more important social network and email links above on small screen sizes.

##### Home
The home page features a short welcome message to the user, followed by a tag line which quickly tells the user the purpose of the business. Immediately below are three circular images on screen sizes 768 pixels wide and above, or 1 circular image on smaller screen sizes. The purpose of the three images on larger screens is to immediately display a selection of examples of work to the user. On smaller screens where only one image is displayed, the image acts as a more standard hero image, giving the user an immediate and stricking example of what the website is about.

Beneath this, the user finds the 'About' section, comprised of a small picture of some of the Festival Faces team along with 3 short sentences that summarise the ethos of the business, provide examples of previous clients and offer a link to 'get in touch'. The picture, with the three women all smiling establishes a human connection between business and the user, as well as providing reasurrance that this business is operated by friendly and happy people. The copy contained in the 'About' section is kept short and to the point so as not to overwhelm the user with information, and provide a call to action in the form of the 'get in touch' link which is clearly styled as a clickable link.

The third and final section of the page goes on to highlight very briefly the most common types of events for which the business is booked regularly. This serves as to further reassure the user that 'Festival Faces' is a suitable company to hire for their event. This section also where possible, clearly provides prices for hiring the business and where prices can't be immediately given, another link and invitation to 'get in touch' is provided.

##### Gallery
The gallery page is virtually kept entirely free of text, except to explain to the user that they can 'Click on image to enlarge'. The gallery features an even number of thumbnails horzontally centered, thus ensuring the page is always symmetrical and visually pleasing. The images offer a wide selection of examples of previous work, including face painting, eco glitter and body art. The images also display clientelle of all age groups and genders, so as to reassure the user that this business is approprate for as wide a target market as possible. 
When clicked, the thumbnails open a modal which enlarges the image making it much easier for the user to see. Whist a 'Close' button is offered, the user can click anywhere outside of the modal to close it. This is a commonly used feature throughout web design and therefore expected by the user and good UX.


##### Contact
The contact page is kept very simple, with an invitation to email the business or if prefered use the contact form to send an enquiry. The contact form uses form validation to ensure appropriate responses have been entered, such as the use of an @ charactor in the email address field. On screens 768 pixels or wider, and attractive image of a facepainter testing paint on her arm whilst surrounded by paints and brushes is displayed. This is a nice way to fill the space and further reinforce the authentic and creative nature of the business.

#### Potential Future Features
* A hero video in place of the three images found on the home page. This would be an improved method of quickly establishing the businesses purpose and ethos.
* An alternative to the modal code found in the Gallery page. Using Javascript, the code could be much more readable and maintainable.
* A thank you message in the form of a modal when the user sends an enquiry through the contact form.
