### Colour Scheme
The colours found throughout the website have been taken from the company logo. The main body of the website is a lighter shade of the blue found in the logo and navigation bar. The outcomes of using the lighter shade chosen are:
* Clearer contrast between the background colour and font colour.
* More contrast between the images and background colour.
* A light and non oppressive user experience when compared to a heavy, darker colour.

An even lighter shade of the logo blue can be found in the 'Services' area of the home page, as well as in the Gallery page and the Contact page. This was used in the Gallery page to further accentuate the contrast between images and the background colour. The lighter shade was used in the 'Services' section and on the Contact page to break up the content and to draw the eye of the user to the key information on the page. 

The 'Send' button at the bottom of the contact form is the same blue from the logo, ensuring the element is consistent with the rest of the website.
